# Workout Loggin app

My first go at working with React Native and I wanted to do an app where you could save the workouts you've finished.
It allows you to create a name for an exercise along with info for the number of reps, sets and rest time you took.
You can then create a workout using exercises you've created and they are stored for future use. 
Finally you can save what workouts you have finished by going into the History screen and choosing a created workout and giving them a date. 

The UX could be improved quote a lot, since I initally started coding with minimal regard to the flow of actions.

Possible improvements to do:
1. Allow the user to define the exercise properties themselves, such as sets, reps, intervals etc, since not all exercises don't include sets/reps. Then when creating a workout the user could pick an exercise and enter the values for the properties given.
2. Combine the Workouts and History screen into one, allowing you to create and log the workout on the same screen.
3. Somehow display the logged workouts in a calendar providing a good overview of the years workout progress.
